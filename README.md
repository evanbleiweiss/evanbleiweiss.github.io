## NPM

Works like Bundler in Ruby. However, unlike Bundler, packages are installed via CLI.
In order to get something like a Gemfile, use the `--save` or `--save-dev` options (depending on the 'group' using the util. 

i.e. `npm install --save-dev gulp-webserver`

## Bower

To get bower to keep track of the versions of its installed components, use `bower intall <package> --save`.
Optionally, use `bower intall <package> --save-dev` if a dependency is dev specific.
